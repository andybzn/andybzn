- 🧑🏻‍💻 Homelabbing (ask me about my k3s cluster)
- 📦 Resisting the urge to buy more computers (this isn't working)
- 🏡 Home automation!

## ⚡ Fun facts

- 🐧 After years of using Windows, I've finally migrated away to solely Unix devices
- ☕️ Some say, my blood is more caffeine than actual blood at this point, and that if you stare hard enough, you might see the tiny robot controlling me

- ❄️ I only broke my nixos install once, and it was a doozy
